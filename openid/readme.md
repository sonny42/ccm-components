This component is **deprecated**. 
This component provides functions to perform OpenId Connect authentication within *ccm* components. However OpenId Connect relies heavily on HTTP redirects which does not work well with *ccm* components. Also this is build on a very outdated *ccm* version and will no longer be maintained.
